This plugin defines a function for automatically cleaning up the imports
in a python module or program. It does two things:

 - removes unused imports
 - sorts and formats the remaining imports

This function is mapped to <LocalLeader>i (for "import") in two contexts.
In Normal mode, it operates on the current paragraph.
In Visual mode, it operates on the selected range.

The python 'tokenize' module is used to determine which symbols are used
in the current buffer, so the script is pretty good at identifying unused imports.

The import formatting style was chosen to work well with grep - the name of
the module and the symbols imported from it are guaranteed to always
appear on the same line.
